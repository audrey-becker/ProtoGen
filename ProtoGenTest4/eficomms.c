 * will be computed and stored. The EFI maintains a hash of the actual
 * configuration which is compared with the stored value, generating a
 * parameter mismatch error if the two values are different. In addition, if a
 * hash is computed and stored, the EFI will be locked.
 * 
 * When sending this packet to the EFI the values `storedParameterHash` and
 * `actualParameterHash` are used as a command flag. Setting these to
 * `0x00000000` and `0xFFFFFFFF` respectively will cause the EFI to disable the
 * parameter mismatch check (and the EFI will not be locked). Any other value
 * results in the computation and storage of the parameter hash, triggering the
 * parameter mismatch check.
 * 
 * When this packet comes from the EFI `storedParameterHash` will be
 * `0x00000000` if the parameter mismatch check is disabled. If you change the
 * EFI configuration (by sending a configuration packet) the EFI will recompute
 * and resend the new configuration hash the next time it outputs slow

 * \brief Create the efiCommConfiguration packet
 *
 * Configuration information for communications, including Controller Area
 * Network (CAN) setup, Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) baud
 * rate, and telemetry output options. If you select a baud rate (UART or CAN)
 * which is too low to accommodate the telemetry output rates, the rates will
 * be adjusted down until the expected bandwidth fits the available data rate.
 * If you select the option `setToDefault` the UART baud rate will be set to
 * 57600 bits per second, the fast telemetry rate will be 20Hz, and the slow
 * telemetry rate will be 1Hz.
 * 
 * The CAN configuration supports multiple options and protocols. The primary
 * CAN protocol is the *native protocol*, which implements the packet-over-CAN
 * schema to move packets as documented in this ICD. The native protocol
 * includes input and output base identifiers, as well as a broadcast
 * identifier. The input and output identifier must be unique on the CAN bus;
 * but the broadcast identifier can be common with other EFIs on the bus. If
 * you select the option `setToDefault` the native protocol will be configured
 * to run at 1Mbit, with long identifiers, a type shift of 16 bits, an input
 * identifier of `0x1E00xxxx`, and an output identifier of `0x1F00xxxx` (where
 * `xxxx` are the lower 16 bits of the EFI serial number).
 * 
 * In addition to the native communications protocol three other protocols are
 * supported (Currawong, Piccolo, Performance Electronics). If you set
 * `enableCurrawongECU` the EFI will emulate the communications protocol used
 * by the [CE367
 * ECU](http://www.currawongeng.com/uav-engines/engine-control-unit/) from
 * Currawong Engineering. The emulation of this interface includes telemetry,
 * commands, and configuration packets, see the Currawong ECU ICD for details.
 * The `enableCurrawongECU` bit is an option for both the UART and the CAN
 * interface. On the UART interface the Currawong protocol runs at 57600 bits
 * per second, and runs simultaneously with the native protocol (the EFI
 * discriminates based on the packet format). The EFI will use the
 * `alternativeProtocolAddress` for the address field in the Currawong serial
 * packet. When using `enableCurrawongECU` with the CAN interface the EFI will
 * generate CAN frames from `0x0800xxxx` through `0x0818xxxx` (where `xxxx` are
 * the `alternativeProtocolAddress`), and will process CAN frames from
 * `0x0900xxxx` through `0x0918xxxx` (where `xxxx` are
 * `alternativeProtocolAddress`, or `0xFFFF`).
 * 
 * The second alternative protocol is enabled with the option
 * `enablePiccoloECU`. This protocol is only available on the CAN bus. You
 * cannot simultaneously set `enablePiccoloECU` and `enableCurrawongECU` on the
 * CAN bus, if you do the EFI will negate `enablePiccoloECU`. When using
 * `enablePiccoloECU` the EFI will generate CAN frames from `0x0880xxxx`
 * through `0x0884xxxx` (where `xxxx` are the `alternativeProtocolAddress`),
 * and will process CAN frames from `0x0990xxxx` through `0x0991xxxx` (where
 * `xxxx` are the `alternativeProtocolAddress`, or `0xFFFF`). Details of this
 * protocool can be had in the Piccolo communications ICD. The [Piccolo
 * autopilot](http://www.cloudcaptech.com/products/auto-pilots) CAN bus can
 * work with either the Piccolo ECU or the Currawong ECU protocol. When using
 * either protocol the CAN baud rate will be forced to 1Mbit, and the
 * `outputBaseID` and `inputBaseID` must *not* be `0x08xxxxxx` or `0x09xxxx`,
 * or the native output and input should be disabled.
 * 
 * The third alternative protocol is enabled with the option `enablePE3ECU`.
 * This is an output only protocol that emulates the CAN bus outputs of the
 * Performance Electronics PE3 ECU. You can use the `enablePE3ECU`
 * simultaneously with `enablePiccoloECU`, but not with `enableCurrawongECU` on
 * the CAN bus. The PE3 protocol option does not force the CAN baud rate, and
 * it does not follow the fast and slow telemetry rates; instead using the
 * telemetry rates specified by the Performance Electronics protocol (20Hz,
 * 10Hz, and 1Hz).
 * 
 * The fourth alternative protocol is enabled with the option `enableGCU`. This
 * is a CAN bus protocol which should be enabled if you want to decode
 * telemetry from the Northwest or Millswood generator control unit. This
 * protocol can be enabled with all other protocols and does not force the CAN
 * baud rate. If this protocol is enabled, and if a GCU is sending telemetry on
 * the CAN bus, IntelliJect will parse the telemetry data and forward it using
 * the [TelemetryGCU packet](#EFI_PKT_TELEMETRYGCU).
 * 
 * When using the Currawong, Piccolo, or PE3 alternative protocols the EFI will
 * suppress the native protocol telemetry output on the interface. However if a
 * native protocol packet is received on the interface the EFI will resume
 * output of the native protocol telemetry.

 * \brief Decode the efiSensorConfiguration packet

 * This packet gives configuration information for a single sensor. Send this
 * packet with just the first byte to request a specific sensor configuration.
 * Sensor configuration includes the sensor gain and offset, the minimum and
 * maximum sensor readings beyond which the sensor is considered bad, and the
 * default sensor value to use if the sensor is bad or disabled. If the sensor
 * is configured as a kty84 or kty83 temperature sensor the gain should be
 * nominally 1 and the offset nominally 0. If `enableAutocorrect` is set the
 * sensor's calibration will be automatically adjusted to correct errors (if
 * possible). The only automatically corrected sensor is the MAP sensor
 * (pressure offset is corrected against Baro when engine is off).
 * 
 * Sensor readings and error status are available in the [telemetry

 *
 * Configuration information for the injector. The EFI supports three injector
 * outputs. The injectors are operated so that the sum of all injectors is
 * equal to the desired fuel output. The proportion of fuel that each injector
 * outputs is controlled through the injector ratio tables. The EFI also
 * supports injector skipping, in which short fuel injection pulses are
 * accumulated into longer pulses for more precise control of the fuel
 * delivery.
 * 
 * Injectors can be configured to operate independently, which means that the
 * fuel multiplier that comes from temperature is determined independently for
 * each injector. There are four temperature sensors: a dedicated MAT sensor,
 * two dedicated CHT sensors, and a spare sensor that can be configurable as a
 * second MAT or third CHT. If the spare temp sensor is configured as manifold
 * temp the fuel multiplier for injector1 is based on CHT1 and MAT, the fuel
 * multiplier for injector2 is based on CHT2 and spare temp, and the fuel
 * multiplier for injector3 is the average of injector1 and 2. If the spare
 * temp sensor is configured as cylinder temp the fuel multiplier for injector1
 * is based on CHT1 and MAT, the fule multiplier for injector2 is based on CHT2
 * and MAT, and the fuel multiplier for injector3 is based on spare temp and
